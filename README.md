# cube-display
Renders a 2D representation of a 3D polygon model to the screen using lines, like it would be drawn on a blackboard, and has controls for rotating the figure with a specific angle on each of the axes and scaling the figure (applying a homothecy).

This was done as a personal project only for entertainment and educational purposes.

## TODO
- [x] Implement orthogonal view
- [x] Add figure selector
- [ ] Draw axes on the screen for reference
- [ ] Add rotation with arbitrary pivot
- [ ] Add translations
- [ ] Implement perspective view
